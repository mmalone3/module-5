Project Title: Activity Tracker

Objective: Develop a web-based activity tracker that allows users to log and manage their daily activities.

Components and Functionality:

User Interface:
HTML Structure: The interface includes a file input for JSON files, activity buttons, a timer display, and control buttons for tracking activities.
CSS Styling: The design is responsive, with styles for different screen sizes and interactive elements like buttons and activity items.
JavaScript Logic:
Activity Tracking: Users can start, stop, and toggle tracking for predefined activities (Work, Sleep, Study, Anything Else).
Timer System: A timer updates every second to show elapsed time for the current activity.
Activity History: Activities are stored in localStorage and displayed in a history section.
Data Storage:
Local Storage: Activity sessions are saved in the browser's localStorage for persistence.
File Handling: Users can save activity history as a JSON file and upload files for data import.
External Interactions:
File Input: Allows users to upload JSON files containing activity data.
Download Link: Provides a way to download the activity history as a JSON file.
Responsive Design:
Media Queries: Adjusts layout and button sizes for screens smaller than 600px.
Use Cases:

Start Tracking: Initiates a new activity session and updates the UI.
Stop Tracking: Ends the current session and saves the data.
Toggle Tracking: Switches between starting and stopping the timer.
Save Times: Exports the activity history to a JSON file.
Clear Times: Resets the activity history and clears the display.
